                    <p>Milkha Singh (20 November 1929 â€“ 18 June 2021), also known as The       Flying Sikh, was an Indian track and field sprinter who was introduced to the sport while serving in the Indian Army.</p> 
                    <ul class="text-align">       
                        <li>He is the only athlete to win gold at 400 metres at the Asian Games as well as the Commonwealth Games.</li>
                        <li>He also won gold medals in the 1958 and 1962 Asian Games.</li>
                        <li>He represented India in the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne, the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome and the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo.</li>
                        <li>He was awarded the Padma Shri, India's fourth-highest civilian honour, in recognition of his sporting achievements.</li>

                         <li>The race for which Singh was best remembered is his fourth-place finish in the 400 metres final at the 1960 Olympic Games, which he had entered as one of the favourites.</li>
                         <li>He led the race till the 200m mark before easing off, allowing others to pass him. Various records were broken in the race, which required a photo-finish and saw American Otis Davis being declared the winner by one-hundredth of a second over German Carl Kaufmann. </li> 
                         <li>Singh's fourth-place time of 45.73 seconds was the Indian national record for almost 40 years.</li>

                        <li>From beginnings that saw him orphaned and displaced during the Partition of India, Singh has become a sporting icon in his country. In 2008, journalist Rohit Brijnath described Singh as "the finest athlete India has ever produced".</li>

                         <li>Singh died of COVID-19 complications on 18 June 2021.</li>
                     </ul>
